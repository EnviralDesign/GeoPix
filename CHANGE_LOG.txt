15193	added changelog developer post save window	after the project is saved, a window pops up and changes made during the last session can be documented.
15194	fixed IO node labels being cut off.	some sort of internal change from the text TOP caused the pre determined offsets to now be incorrect
15195	fixed ctrl+P for unparenting objects	not all selected objects were getting unparented previously.
15196	tweak to changelog launch	Now clears fields when opened.
15197	fixed hover labels on bottom bar 3 main app buttons	had some old messages from before when we could do split screen.
15198	added transport mode parameter to all timing related IO nodes	before doing things like hold, or zero for time extend would last entire duration of macro's play through. needed a way to toggle between local repeat and not.
15199	hooked up transport mode parameter in IO nodes	this allows users to specify if a time based node in a macrotreats it's time extend parameters using absolute macro timeor if they extend time within every single iteration of a macro playthrough.

15210	linked sequence editor extension to py file on disk	
15211	sequence editor now homes to full work area, if no blocks are present.	before it zoomed to some really small portion to the left of the startwhich didn't make sense and left the user more confused.
15212	fixed stray nonsense error	occuring when dragging audio into sequence editor
15213	fixed absolute path bug in sequence editor, dragging audio in	previously dragging audio in, even a file in the local directory structurewould yield a path that was absolute.now it fixes the paths to be relative, if the file exists in the relative directory struct.
15214	creating an ImporGeo object from scratch, it now uses newer File Tool	
15215	fixed off by 1 error in global timeline keyframes	
15216	fixed some selection logic issues for deleted channels, in keyframe editor	if channels were selected on the left, and then deleted with their respectivetrashcan icons then the channels would still be considered selected,and new keyframes added would double, triple, up etc when manually added.
15217	fixed camera bounds homing bug in keyframe editor	like in the sequence editor, if the keyframer had no keys, it would home toan impossibly small region to the left of the working area, and this didn't make sense.
15218	fixed some bugs in the MultiStrobe IO Node.	a) fixed mono color bug not allowing colors to be set. b) added seed value parameter to node, to allow explicit seed valueinstead of the random increment for active on/off that was there before.
15219	fixed bug where duplicated macros didn't maintain internal node consistency	previously duplicating a macro would cause some of the nodes inside to getscrambled and not connected back up correctly.this was easily remedied by making sure the clone immune was on for the GRAPHcomp inside and for all it's children.
15220	fixed NaN bug in shader where objects with no uvs were imported.	
15221	added dynamic Change Log to splash screen.	
15222	Fixed bug in Dmx In Override not applying MultiCast toggle	Multicast toggle for dmx in was not properly hooked up in the backend.
15224	bug fix for dmx in not working with out force cook to module.	
15225	fixed save on exit prompt button	when clicking the application "X", then clicking save, nothing would happen.This now works as expected, launching the file tool, and if the user saves from there, quits the software.

15227	fixed missing file path, updated sponsors	
15228	fixed bug with error reporting and primitive uv detection.

15252	upgraded GeoPix to TD build 2021.13610	
15255	updated build system, added GeoPix.exe to launch GeoPix instead of .bat	build system has a few extra steps via guis when the toe is saved.also, a GeoPix.exe is created/updated when desired to allow for a moreapplication friendly launching, pinning to task bar, etc.
15259	disabled TD network hotkeys for saving/loading so they cannot be used in perform mode	
15261	added ctrl.hotkey support for GeoPix save/load/import/new
