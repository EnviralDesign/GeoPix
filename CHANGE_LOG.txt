15199	hooked up transport mode parameter in IO nodes	this allows users to specify if a time based node in a macrotreats it's time extend parameters using absolute macro timeor if they extend time within every single iteration of a macro playthrough.

15213	fixed absolute path bug in sequence editor, dragging audio in	previously dragging audio in, even a file in the local directory structurewould yield a path that was absolute.now it fixes the paths to be relative, if the file exists in the relative directory struct.

15216	fixed some selection logic issues for deleted channels, in keyframe editor	if channels were selected on the left, and then deleted with their respectivetrashcan icons then the channels would still be considered selected,and new keyframes added would double, triple, up etc when manually added.
15217	fixed camera bounds homing bug in keyframe editor	like in the sequence editor, if the keyframer had no keys, it would home toan impossibly small region to the left of the working area, and this didn't make sense.

15219	fixed bug where duplicated macros didn't maintain internal node consistency	previously duplicating a macro would cause some of the nodes inside to getscrambled and not connected back up correctly.this was easily remedied by making sure the clone immune was on for the GRAPHcomp inside and for all it's children.
